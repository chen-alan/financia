# Financia

This game aims to teach topics like saving money, building credit, and responsibly spending to underprivileged early teens who may not have resources to learn about financial literacy. Lessons are designed with learning theories like constructivism in mind, and the storyline attempts to be as culturally and socioeconomically inclusive as possible to ensure a relatable and engaging gameplay experience.
