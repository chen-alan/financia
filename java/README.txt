GAMEPLAY:
The objective of the game is to reach the trophy in the bottom right corner.
If mario collides with a planet, he loses a life.
When the number of lives reaches 0, you lose the game.
The number of lives are displayed at the top of the screen.
If you reach the trophy before losing all your lives, you win the game.
Press the "Enter" key to replay.

SOUND EFFECTS AND MUSIC:
Music plays continuously throughout the game.
Sound effects play with each collision, win, and loss.

KEYS:
Use arrow keys to move, and other keys as specified to transform mario.
Pivot point moves in relation to mario.
As with Lab 1, if mario is rotated, canvas moves slightly when pivot point is modified or scaling is used.
Because of this, gameplay is best when mario is not rotated.

Press the "2" key to speed up the animation.
Press the <up arrow> to see animations of mario walking to the back of the screen.
Press the <down arrow> to see animations of mario walking to the front of the screen.
