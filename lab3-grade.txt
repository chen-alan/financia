10/10 points: Arrows pan up/down/left/right around the system.
9/10 points: 
	5/5 points: Pressing A rotates the system around the sun’s center point CCW

	-1: Strange jumping of planet position on direction change

EC: 0/10 points: At least 1 planet has an elliptical orbit.

Total Grade: 99/100

Nice job! The only thing is that when the planets change direction they jump to the other side of the orbit. Kind of odd and not a good behavior, but not the biggest deal.
